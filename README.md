# Podto.app: Photo Gallery

## What is it?
v1: fetches 10 id from the <a href='https://picsum.photos/'>Picsum API</a> and present them in a flexbox grid.
When the user clicks on any of the grid, the main display area shows that pictures.
At the moment, I have decided not to randomize the list of photos. The api has some random id that won't provide a picture. In order to guarantee that everyone will have the same experience, I have limited it to the same 10 images.

In the future, I plan to use the unsplash api to generate the 10 ten most viewed/commented photos on their platform if the api provides that data. Ideally, I want to create my own backend to make this a full-stack application.

For now, this is it!
