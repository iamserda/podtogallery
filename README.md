# Podto.app: Photo Gallery

## What is it?
The iPod classic merged with Instagram. A Frontend project for the picsum API. Presenting images as flexible grid.

v1: fetches 10 id from the <a href='https://picsum.photos/'>Picsum API</a> and present them in a flexbox grid.
When the user clicks on any grid item, the main display area shows that pictures.

## ISSUES, I am aware of:
At the moment, I have decided not to randomize the list of photos.
This is mostly a PoC, and random photo although great doesn't outweigh the risk of failed url.
At random, the api generates URL with failed link resources which would damage the user experience.
It is more important to me that the the interface works for everyone all the time, rather than randomizing photos.

The idea would be eventually to randomize, maybe the current 9 or 10 most viewed photo of the day on instagram or  for example.

In the future, I plan to use the unsplash api to generate the 10 ten most viewed/commented photos on their platform if the api provides that data. Ideally, I want to create my own backend to turn this into a full-stack application.

For now, this is it!
